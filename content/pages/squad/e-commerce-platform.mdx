## Overview

The E-commerce Platform aims to provide a comprehensive online shopping experience, where users can explore, compare, and purchase products from multiple vendors. Beyond the basics of an online marketplace, the platform aspires to implement cutting-edge features like real-time inventory updates, AI-driven product recommendations, and integrated customer support chatbots. The project encapsulates complexities like secure payment gateways, multi-level user authentication, and an intuitive but highly flexible UI/UX design suitable for both consumers and vendors.

Shopping has transformed in the digital age, and the platform should mirror the modern conveniences and capabilities consumers have come to expect. It should offer a wide array of products from clothing to electronics, integrating filters and sorting mechanisms that allow users to quickly find the products they're looking for. 

Users should be able to view detailed product descriptions, reviews, and ratings. They can add items to their cart and proceed to a secure checkout process, including various payment options like credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or even cryptocurrency. Vendors should have a separate dashboard where they can manage inventory, view analytics, and handle customer queries. Finally, administrators can oversee the entire platform, from user and vendor management to content curation.

## Business Logic

### Core Functionalities

1. **User Roles**: Three types of users—Consumers, Vendors, and Admins—each with their distinct dashboard and functionalities.
2. **Product Management**: Allows vendors to list, update, and manage products.
3. **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Provides users with a shopping cart where they can review items before proceeding to a secure payment gateway.
4. **Reviews and Ratings**: Users can rate and review products they've purchased.
5. **Recommendation Engine**: AI-driven recommendations based on user activity and preferences.
