## Overview

The Auction Platform is a digital marketplace where users can list items for auction and place bids on items of interest. This platform aims to simulate the excitement and competitiveness of a live auction while providing a user-friendly interface that can be accessed from anywhere. Key features include real-time bidding, a countdown timer for each auction, user profiles for buyers and sellers, and a secure payment system.

Security, reliability, and real-time performance are critical to the success of this platform. The system must ensure that bid information is updated in milliseconds to all participants to avoid discrepancies. Additionally, the platform must provide a transparent and fair bidding process, with measures in place to prevent bid sniping and ensure the authenticity of users and listings.

## Business Logic

### Core Functionalities

1. **User Registration**: Separate registration processes for buyers and sellers, including verification steps to enhance security.
2. **Listing Creation**: Sellers can list items for auction, providing descriptions, photos, and setting a minimum bid.
3. **Real-Time Bidding**: Implement WebSockets for real-time bid updates, ensuring all users see bid changes instantly.
4. **Auction Timer**: Each listing has a countdown timer, ending the auction when it reaches zero.
5. **Payment Processing**: Secure payment gateway integration for processing winning bids.

## Technical Requirements

### Front-end

- **Technologies**: React or Next.js for the SPA. Use Socket.IO or native WebSockets for real-time communication.
- **UI/UX Design**: The interface should be engaging and intuitive, with clear listings, live updates, and responsive design for mobile accessibility.

#### Components

1. Listing Page
2. Auction Detail Page
3. Bid History Component
4. User Profile
5. Payment Gateway Integration

- [Socket.IO Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v4)

### Back-end

- **Technologies**: Django with Django Channels for handling WebSockets.
- **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, especially for actions like bidding and listing items.

#### API Endpoints

1. `POST /api/users`: Register a new user
2. `POST /api/listings`: Create a new listing
3. `GET /api/listings`: Retrieve active listings
4. `POST /api/bids`: Place a bid
5. `GET /api/bids/{listing_id}`: Get bid history for a listing

- [Django Channels Documentation](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### Database Architecture

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Tables**: `Users`, `Listings`, `Bids`, `Payments`

- [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)

### Authentication & Security

- **Authentication**: Use JWT for authentication and secure routes that require user identification.
- **Security Practices**: All communications must be over HTTPS. Implement rate limiting and auction rules to prevent bid manipulation.
