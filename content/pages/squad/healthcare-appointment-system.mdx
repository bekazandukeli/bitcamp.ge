## Overview

A Healthcare Appointment System is an application intended to digitize the process of scheduling and managing healthcare appointments. The aim is to create a multi-role platform, where healthcare providers (hospitals, doctors, nurses) and patients can interact seamlessly. This platform should be capable of automating appointment bookings, reminders, billing, and even telehealth consultations.

The system needs to be HIPAA-compliant, ensuring the security and confidentiality of all patient information. It should also integrate with existing hospital databases and Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems where possible. A robust search functionality is necessary for finding available time slots across different departments and specialists. The user interface should be intuitive, ensuring that even individuals who are not tech-savvy can navigate the system with ease.

## Business Logic

### Core Functionalities

1. **Multi-Role System**: Separate roles for patients, healthcare providers, and administrators.
2. **Appointment Management**: Users should be able to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
3. **EHR Integration**: Should be capable of pulling and updating patient records from EHR systems.
4. **Billing & Payments**: Invoicing and payment gateway integration.
5. **Telehealth**: Video consultation option for remote patients.
