## Overview

The Multiplayer Chess App is a platform where chess enthusiasts can come together to play, analyze, and discuss chess games in real-time. Unlike other board game apps, the focus here is not just on the gameplay, but also on fostering a community around the game. The platform aims to offer features that cater to players of all levels, from casual enthusiasts to professional chess players.

Chess has been a staple of intellectual entertainment for centuries. While its rules are straightforward, the complexity and strategies that emerge from these rules are what captivate millions worldwide. This platform aims to embrace this complexity by offering various modes, community features, and analytics that help players improve their game and enjoy the rich experience that chess has to offer.

Once registered, users can enter different "rooms" based on their skill levels, interests, or specific game types they wish to play (Blitz, Rapid, Classical). The app will match players with opponents of similar skill levels, ensuring fair and challenging matches. Users can also join rooms created around specific themes or challenges, like "Queen's Gambit Week" or "Endgame Challenges."

During gameplay, players can also opt for real-time analysis, which uses a chess engine to provide insights into the game's current state. Players can review these insights later to improve their strategies. The app will also offer post-game analytics that break down each move, showing how it affected the game's outcome.

## Business Logic
