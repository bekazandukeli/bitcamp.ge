# Personal Finance Tracker

## Overview

The Personal Finance Tracker is envisioned as a comprehensive financial management hub. The software aims to offer a seamless experience that unites different aspects of personal finance into one accessible and interactive platform. Users can keep an eye on income and expenses, but also manage and assess other areas like investments, loans, and financial goals, without needing to switch between different applications.

The importance of financial literacy has become increasingly apparent in today's fast-paced society. However, tracking income and expenses, managing investments, budgeting, and planning for the future can be overwhelming when using disparate tools or traditional methods like spreadsheets. This platform is designed to simplify financial management by combining all these functions into one cohesive interface.

Users will start by setting up their profile, where they can list multiple income streams, their expenditures, liabilities like loans and credit card debts, and investment portfolios. The application will automatically categorize these into various buckets for more straightforward analysis and planning. From this profile, users can view a dashboard that provides real-time updates on key metrics such as net worth, spending patterns, saving rates, and investment returns.

The platform doesn't just passively display dataâ€”it actively helps users optimize their financial plans. For example, machine learning algorithms analyze spending habits and suggest how to reallocate funds for better results. The platform will even offer investment recommendations based on the user's risk profile and past behavior. Additionally, the platform offers multi-currency support, recognizing the growing needs of digital nomads and people who work or invest across multiple countries.

Lastly, data security is of paramount importance. The application will employ industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols to ensure that sensitive financial information is securely stored and transmitted.

## Business Logic

### Core Functionalities

1. **Dashboard**: A central hub showing key financial statistics, including net worth, monthly cash flow, and investment performance.

2. **Income Management**: Users can record multiple income sources, such as salaries, freelance gigs, and investments, and view summaries by week, month, or year.

3. **Expense Tracking**: Users can log expenditures under various categories like Food, Utilities, and Leisure, and set spending limits per category.

4. **Investment Management**: Tracks real-time investment data and provides recommendations based on historical behavior and market trends.

5. **Budget Planning**: Users can create monthly or annual budgets, which the system auto-allocates based on historical data and future predictions.

6. **Reports and Analysis**: Users can generate downloadable reports for specific financial aspects, like taxes or spending trends.
