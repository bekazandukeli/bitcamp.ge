## Overview

A Learning Management System (LMS) serves as the backbone of any online educational experience. The objective is to build a robust, scalable, and intuitive platform that caters to instructors, students, and administrators. Instructors should be able to create and manage courses, upload content, and evaluate student performance. Students will be able to enroll in courses, interact with instructors and peers, and track their progress. Administrators will have oversight over the entire system, managing users and content.

The LMS should not only be a repository of courses and materials but also a vibrant learning community. Features like real-time chat, discussion boards, and peer review would enrich the educational experience. Additionally, the platform should be able to host various types of content such as videos, PDFs, quizzes, and even interactive coding challenges for tech courses.

Security is paramount, especially when handling user data and course materials that could be proprietary. Therefore, the system needs robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, encryption, and secure data storage.

## Business Logic

### Core Functionalities

1. **User Roles**: Distinct roles for Students, Instructors, and Administrators, each with unique functionalities.
2. **Course Management**: Instructors can create and manage course content, set deadlines, and grade submissions.
3. **Enrollment & Progress Tracking**: Students can enroll in courses, submit assignments, and track their progress.
4. **Community Features**: Discussion boards, peer reviews, and real-time chats.
5. **Reporting & Analytics**: Both instructors and administrators can generate various reports related to course performance and user engagement.
